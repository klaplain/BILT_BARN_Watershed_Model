# Project Definition
Bainbridge Island Land Trust (BILT) asked Bainbridge Artisan Resource Network (BARN) to create a 3D model of Bainbridge Island that could be used to educate people about the Bainbridge Island Watersheds.
# Contour Map
The contour data was obtained from https://touchterrain.geol.iastate.edu/main and a Z exaggeration of 4 was used
# Creating the 3D Tiles
The resultant STL file (10m_-122.53_47.65_tile_1_1.STL)  was then sliced using Prusa Slicer using a 0.1mm layer height.  
The 3mf file was divided into 16 smaller 3MF tiles so that each tile would fit onto the bed of a Prusa Mk4
Each tile was printed in Light Brown Hatchbox PETG with a 15% infill
# Assembly
The tiles were glued together and placed in a wooden tray cut from 3mm MDF.  Tray design is in tray.svg
# Creating the Map Label
The Label in the top right of the frame was laser cut using an XTool F1 laser.  Label design is in LandTrustBARNLogo.svg
# Creating the Road Overlay
A polycarbonate overlay showing roads was laser cut.  Design is in BainbridgeMapLT.svg
